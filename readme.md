## Firebase Firestore Database Structure

The chat app uses Firebase Firestore for storing chat messages and room information. The Firestore database structure consists of three collections: `rooms`, `users`, and `directMessages`.

### Rooms Collection

The `rooms` collection stores the information about all the chat rooms. Each document in the `rooms` collection represents a chat room. The document ID is the unique ID of the room generated by Firestore. The document contains the following fields:

- `name`: The name of the room.
Additionally, each document contains a subcollection `messages` that stores all the messages sent in the room. Each document in the `messages` subcollection represents a message. The document ID is the unique ID of the message generated by Firestore. The document contains the following fields:

- `senderName`: The name of the user who sent the message.
- `userId`: The ID of the user who sent the message.
- `text`: The message text.
- `timestamp`: The timestamp of the message.
- `senderProfilePicture`: The profile picture of the user who sent the message.

### Users Collection

The `users` collection stores the information about all the users. Each document in the `users` collection represents a user. The document ID is the ID of the user generated by Firestore. The document contains the following fields:

- `username`: The name of the user.
- `profilePicture`: The profile picture of the user.
- `userId`: The ID of the user.
- `email`: The email of the user.

### Direct Messages Collection

The `directMessages` collection stores the information about all the direct messages. Each document in the `directMessages` collection represents a direct message. The document ID is the ID of the direct message generated by Firestore. The document contains the following fields:

It has subcollection `messages` that stores all the messages sent in the direct message. Each document in the `messages` subcollection represents a message. The document ID is the unique ID of the message generated by Firestore. The document contains the following fields:

- `senderName`: The name of the user who sent the message.
- `senderId`: The ID of the user who sent the message.
- `text`: The message text.
- `timestamp`: The timestamp of the message.
- `senderProfilePicture`: The profile picture of the user who sent the message.

#### This Firestore data structure allows for efficient retrieval and organization of room information, user details, and direct message conversations within the chat app.
